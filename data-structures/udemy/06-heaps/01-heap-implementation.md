## Heap Implementation


### Heap properties
- All properties of Binary heap are fulfilled.
- For min heap root node has the minimum value.
- Parent node has always less value than the child node.
- Binary heap tree is always a height balanced tree.
- It can be easily implemented using Python arrays or linked list.
- It's use case if for sorting because adding the element or finding the element takes O(log(N)) time as against adding a new element in sorted array which takes O(N) time.
- For deletion of node from heap, only root node can be removed.
