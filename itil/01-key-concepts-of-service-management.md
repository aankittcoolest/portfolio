## Key Concepts of Service Management

#### Service

- Service is defined as a "means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks."

#### Utility

- Utility is defined as the functionality offered by the product or service to meet a particular need.
- Utility can be summarized as 'what the service does' and can be used to determine whether a service is 'fit to purpose'
- To have utility, a service must either support the performance of the consumer or remove constraints from the consumer. Many services do both.

#### Warranty

- Warranty is defined as the assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements.
- Warranty can be summarized as 'how the service performs' and can be used to determine whether a service is 'fit to use'.
- Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. They may be based on the formal agreement, or it may be a marketing message or brand image.
