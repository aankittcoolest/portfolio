#### Continual Improvement

- Align the organization's practices and services with changing business needs through the ongoing identification and improvement of services, service components and/or practices.

- Continual Improvement Model:

  - What is the vision
  - Where are we now
  - Where do we want to be
  - How do we get there
  - Take action
  - Did we get there
  - How do we keep the momentum going

- Imrovements should be data driven: Use Continual Improvement Registers (CIRs)

#### Change Enablement

- Maximize the number of successful IT changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed and managing a change schedule.

- Assign appropriate change autorities to differing areas.
- Following are the change types:
  1. Standard
  2. Normal

- Service requests may be simple or complex.
- They should be well understood and predictable, they can be pre-defined as part of normal service.
- Some are effectively pre-authorized.

#### Service Desk
